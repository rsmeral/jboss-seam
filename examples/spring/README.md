Seam Spring Example
===================

This example shows Seam/Spring integration. This application runs on AS as
a WAR file.

Running the example
-------------------

To deploy the example to a running JBoss AS instance, follow these steps:

1. In the example root directory run:

        mvn clean install

2. Set JBOSS_HOME environment property.

3. In the spring-web directory run:

        mvn jboss-as:deploy

4. Open this URL in a web browser: http://localhost:8080/spring-web


Testing the example
-------------------

This example is covered by functional tests. All tests use the following technologies:

* __Arquillian__ -  as the framework for EE testing, for managing of container lifecycle and deployment of test archive,
* __ShrinkWrap__ - to create the test archive (WAR).


### Functional tests

Functional tests are located in a separate project and are not executed during the build of the example. They test the built archive in an application server through browser-testing. They use:

* __Arquillian Graphene Extension__ - an advanced Ajax-capable type-safe Selenium-based browser testing tool,
* __Arquillian Drone Extension__ - to automatically run and stop browser instances.

_Note: It is necessary to first build and install the example, because the functional test resolves the test artifact from the local Maven repository._

Run the functional test on JBoss AS instance with
    
    mvn -f hibernate-ftest/pom.xml clean test

The `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable must be set and point to a JBoss AS instance directory.

To test on a running server, use

    mvn -f hibernate-ftest/pom.xml clean test -Dremote

Testing in JBDS
---------------

### Functional tests

It is not possible to run the functional tests of this example in JBDS, because they use the maven-dependency-plugin to copy test classes from a different maven artifact, which is not a configuration supported by JBDS.
